# Tic-tac-toe
This is a website where you can play classic tic-tac-toe or 5x tic-tac-toe. You can access by searching [krakalaka.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://krakalaka.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).

## How to play tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is played on a 3 by 3 grid. To win you have to connect 3 simbols horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The first to play is usually the X and after the O. It's a turn-based game, which means that one player play first and only after que finishes his turn the second player can play. If all the boxes of the grid are filled and no one has connected 3 of his simbols, then the game is a draw.

## How to play the 5x tic-tac-toe
The 5x tic-tac-toe is like the classic one, but it is played on a 5 by 5 grid and instead of connecting 3 simbols to win you have to connect 4 simbols. Other than that, all the rules are the same.

## About the project
This is the second website I try using Javascript but I think I didn't used the JS the way you would expect (which is to make the frontend of a website instead of making a game).

## Plans to do
If you already checked the website you may have noticed that there is an option to play against a bot but you can not choose this option because I didn't implemented this feature yet. I'm implement it on the future, just wait because I'm learning how to make a minimax algorithm.
I'm also planning to make this site responsive.
